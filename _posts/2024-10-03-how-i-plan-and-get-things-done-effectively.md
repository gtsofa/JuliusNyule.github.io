I used to wonder how some people managed to excel in both their careers and personal lives. We all have the same 24 hours, yet some seem to balance work, family, fitness, and personal time so effortlessly. How do they find time to grow in their careers without sacrificing other parts of life?.

After some research and personal experience, I discovered a few planning strategies and tools that can help anyone, myself included, become more productive. Here’s how you can do it too!

# 1. Plan Ahead

I like to plan my entire week on Sunday evening or the night before. This way, I’m prepared for what’s ahead. Here’s what I do:

- List Your Priorities: I make a list of the key tasks I need to focus on for the day. Whether you use a notebook, a Notes app, or any other tool, just make sure it works for you.

Example of my task list:

1. Study and practice - 2 hours
2. Go biking - 3 hours
3. Read "The Lead Developer Essentials" - 1.5 hours
4. Read "The Software Developer Life Manual" - 1.5 hours
5. Data Structures and Algorithms prep - 1 hour
6. Search and apply for 20 jobs per day - 1.5 hours
7. Wednesdays Coffee breaks Essential Developer - 30mins
8. Blogging - 1.5 hours
9. Interview prep - 30 minutes
10. Review and reflect - 30 minutes


- Schedule Tasks: Once I have my list, I figure out how much time each task will take. Then, I add them to my Google Calendar. You can use any calendar app you prefer.

# 2. Get Things Done
With your plan in place, it’s time to execute! I use the Pomodoro technique to stay focused:

1. Set a timer and focus on one task for 40 minutes.
2. Take a 5-minute break after each session.
3. Repeat!

During breaks, I like to move around and do quick exercises like squats or push-ups, jump jacks, jump ropes, or have some nuts or popcorn. I always have my yoga mat nearby. These breaks help me stay energized throughout the day.

At first, it might be hard to focus for the full 40 minutes or whatever time you set. You’ll probably think about things like being hungry or feeling tired. That’s normal! The key is to stay disciplined. Over time, your brain will get used to the routine, and it’ll become easier to stay focused.

Some benefits you’ll notice:

- Increased focus will help you solve problems more efficiently.
- The short breaks will keep you refreshed and less tired.


# 3. Review and Reflect
At the end of each day, take 30 minutes to review and reflect on your schedule. Life is unpredictable, so it’s important to adjust your plan as needed.

Ask yourself:

- Where did I get distracted?
- What did I accomplish today?
- What did I learn today?

Then, look at your plan for tomorrow and see if you can improve it based on today’s experience. Finally, get a good night’s rest and recharge for the next day.

By sticking to these strategies, you’ll find yourself more productive, more focused, and better equipped to manage your time effectively. Happy planning!
