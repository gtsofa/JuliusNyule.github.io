Rust is a powerful systems programming language that has gained popularity in recent years. It guarantees memory- and thread-safety through a rich type system and a unique ownership model.

I'm introducing [Rust for Java Developers](https://chrischiedo.github.io/rust-for-java-devs/), a high-level guide for Java Developers who are interested in learning Rust.

The guide is not meant to be a replacement for the proper learning of the Rust language via its official documentation (for example the excellent [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)). Instead, the guide should be viewed as a resource that can help answer some questions quickly, like: _Does Rust support inheritance, interfaces, virtual threads, etc.?_ Or more generally, _how can I do X in Rust_? (based on your Java knowledge).

Assumptions:

- Reader is relatively comfortable with Java.
- Reader is completely new to Rust.

Goals:

- Provide a brief comparison and mapping of various Java topics to their
  counterparts in Rust.
- Provide links to other Rust references, books and articles for further reading on
  various topics.

Non-goals:

- Discussion of design patterns and architectures.
- Tutorial on the Rust language.
- Make reader proficient in Rust after reading this guide.
- While there are short examples that contrast Java and Rust code for some
  topics, this guide is not meant to be a cookbook of coding recipes in the
  two languages.

The guide is divided into fourteen chapters:

1. Getting Started
1. Hello World
1. Language Features
1. Memory Management
1. Resource Management
1. Threading and Concurrency
1. Testing
1. Benchmarking
1. Logging and Tracing
1. Environment and Configuration
1. Build Tools
1. Project Structure
1. Meta Programming
1. Asynchronous Programming
