## The Essential App (iOS)

Essential App is designed to deliver a great user experience for users sharing their image feed with their friends.

The app was conceived as a platform that I can use to learn and apply the fundamentals of software development which are independent of the language or platform we use that include: modular design, automated testing, dependency management, codebase health monitoring, short release cycles, effective version-control, excellent cross-team communication as shared by Essentials Developer Academy by Caio and Mike.
