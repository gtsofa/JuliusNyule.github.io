My name is Julius Nyule, I am from Nairobi, Kenya and I am an iOS Engineer. My background is in Computer Science and Mathematics. I specifically majored in Computer Science, which was offered as a sub-discipline in the CS department.

I have spent a good chunk of my professional life working in the software engineering space: as a software developer (iOS) in the Apple platform. I have also served as a web developer.

Over the years, I've worked with Ruby, Python, Dart, and Swift.

My most recent work as a developer was working for a startup firm as an iOS software engineer (short-term contract). I was part of a team that worked on the iOS applications (I specifically worked on maintaining and adding new features to the Ringtones for iPhone, Breathing Exercises, and Make Ringtones iOS apps). Some of the technologies that we used are: Swift, UIKit, Core Data, URLSession, Core Animation.

I've previously worked at [Etinx](https://www.etinx.com/) as an iOS Developer. I build an iOS app from scratch after which another iOS developer joined the team a few months later. In this capacity, I developed an online investment platform designed to make investments in local and global financial markets more accessible, secure and affordable. I also onboarded new team members as well as offered mentorship to junior team members.

I've also worked at [Andela](https://www.andela.com/) as a software development apprenticeship (as a team member that worked on various internal projects for Andela).

Prior to shifting into the industry, I worked in the BPO and saaS spaces, as a technical customer support at [Sama](https://www.sama.com/) and [xFusion](https://www.xfusion.io/).

I am currently pursuing a part-time online course in iOS Development at 
the [The Essential Developer Academy by Caio and Mike](https://www.essentialdeveloper.com/), (2022 - present).

I'm naturally a very curious person, and I particularly enjoy learning new things every day. I feel energized when working with small, highly motivated teams that care deeply about delivering business results.
